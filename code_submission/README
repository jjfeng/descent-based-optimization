External packages needed:
* CVXPY is required for all scripts
* Biopython is required to run the script for Section 5

Section 3 results were generated as follows:
* Elastic Net:
    python elasticnet_eval.py
* Sparse group lasso:
    python grouped_lasso_eval.py -p -d 1
* Additive partially linear model with two penalties:
    python aplm2_eval.py

Section 4 results were generated as follows:
* Unpooled sparse group lasso:
    python grouped_lasso_eval.py -d [1,2,3]
* Additive partially linear model with three penalties:
    python aplm3_eval.py -d [0,1,2]
* Nonparametric Additive Model:
    python three_gam_eval.py

Section 5 results were generated as follows:
    python realdata_colitis_fullcv.py
