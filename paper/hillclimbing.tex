\section*{Abstract}
Tuning regularization parameters in regression problems allows one to control model complexity and induce desired structure. The current method of searching over a $k$-dimensional grid of parameter values is computationally intractable for $k>2$. We propose tuning the penalty parameters more efficiently by treating it as a continuous optimization problem and updating the parameter values using subgradient descent. We demonstrate that this method of ``joint optimization" achieves the same performance as cross validation over a grid. Joint optimization enables us to test regularizations with many penalty parameters, through which we discover new regularization methods that attain superior accuracy. Our experiments are performed on simulated and real data.

\section{Introduction}

Consider the usual regression problem with $p$ features and a response measured on $n$ observations. Let $X$ denote the $n \times p$ design matrix and $y$ the response vector. For ill-posed or high-dimensional problems ($p \gg n$), there can often be an infinite number of solutions that minimize the loss function $L$ but have high generalization error. A common solution is to use regularization, or penalization, to select models with desirable properties, such as smoothness and sparsity.

In recent years, there has been much interest in combining regularization methods to produce models with many favorable characteristics. Examples include the elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2003), which combines the lasso and ridge penalties, and the sparse group lasso (Simon 2007), which combines the group lasso and lasso penalties. The general form of these regression problems is:

\begin{equation} \label {eq:basic}
\hat f(\lambda_1, ..., \lambda_k) = \arg \min_f L(y, f (X)) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \lambda_i J_i(f)
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the loss function, $\{J_i\}_{i=1, ..., k}$ are the penalty functions, and $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1, ..., k}$ are the regularization parameters.

Regularization parameters control the degree of various facets of model complexity (e.g. amount of sparsity or smoothness). Often, the goal is to set the parameters to minimize the fitted model's generalization error. We estimate this using cross-validation, which fits a model on a training set $(X_T, y_T)$ and measures the model's error on a validation set $(X_V, y_V)$. The goal then is to choose penalty parameters that minimize the validation error, as formulated in the following optimization problem:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\min_{\boldsymbol{\lambda} \in \Lambda} L(y_V, \hat f (X_V | \boldsymbol{\lambda})) \\
\text{where } \hat f(\cdot | \boldsymbol{\lambda}) = \arg \min_f L(y_T, f (X_T)) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \lambda_i J_i(f)
\end{array}
\label{jointopt}
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\text{where } \hat f(\cdot | \boldsymbol{\lambda}) = \arg \min_f L(y_T, f (X_T)) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \lambda_i J_i(f)
%\label{jointoptinner}
%\end{equation}

The simplest approach to solving the problem above is brute force: models are fit over a grid of parameter values and the one with the lowest validation error is selected. As long as the grid is large and fine enough, this method of ``grid search" will find a solution close to the global optimum. However, this approach is computationally intractable in cases with more than two parameters. Many variants of grid search have been proposed to increase efficiency, but their runtimes are all exponential in the number of parameters.

In this paper, we propose explicitly solving the continuous optimization problem in (\ref{jointopt}) over the penalty parameter space. We use subgradient descent to update the regularization parameters and use ordinary optimization techniques to solve for the model parameters at each iteration. Simulation studies show that this ``joint optimization" of both model and penalty parameters produces solutions with the same validation error as those from grid search. In addition, we find that our approach is highly efficient and can solve regressions with hundreds of penalty parameters. Finally, we use this method to analyze regularization methods that were previously computationally intractable to run. Through this, we discover that a variant of sparse group lasso with many more penalty parameters can significantly decrease error and produce more meaningful models.

Lorbert and Ramadge (2010) presented some related work on this topic. They solved linear regression problems by updating regression coefficients and regularization parameters using cyclical coordinate gradient descent. We take a more general approach that allows us to apply joint optimization to both linear and nonlinear regressions. This paper focuses on three examples that demonstrate the wide applicability of our method: elastic net, sparse group lasso, and additive partial linear models.

In Section 2, we describe joint optimization in detail and present an algorithm for solving it in example regressions. In Section 3, we show that our method achieves validation errors as low as those achieved by grid search. In Section 4, we explore variants of the example regression problems that have many more regularization parameters and demonstrate that solving the joint optimization problem explicitly is still computationally tractable. Finally, we present results from experiments on real data in Section 5.

\section{Joint Optimization}
\subsection{Definition}
Suppose our given data set is composed of design matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and the response vector $y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$. Let the data set be divided into training and validation observations denoted $(X_T, y_T)$ and $(X_V, y_V)$, respectively.

We propose treating the penalized regression as one continuous optimization problem in the regularization parameter space. We propose solving this ``joint optimization" problem explicitly:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\arg \min_{\boldsymbol{\lambda} \in \Lambda} L(y_V, \hat f (X_V | \boldsymbol{\lambda})) \\
\text{where } \hat f(\cdot | \boldsymbol{\lambda}) = \arg \min_f L(y_T, f (X_T)) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \lambda_i J_i(f)
\end{array}
\label{jointopt2}
\end{equation}

Grid search uses a brute force approach to (\ref{jointopt2}) by discretizing the regularization parameter space into a grid $G$. It fits separate models over every point in the grid and selects the parameters with the lowest validation error:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\arg \min_{f \in F} L(y_V, \hat f (X_V | \boldsymbol{\lambda})) \\
\text{where } F = \{ \arg \min_f L(y_T, f (X_T)) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \lambda_i J_i(f) | \boldsymbol{\lambda} \in G\}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Figure \ref{fig:compare} illustrates how grid search calculates the validation loss for the complete grid, even though many grid points are not close to the global or local minima. There seems to be a faster solution though: we can just descend this surface along the gradient. This serves as the motivation for our method.

We propose using a hillclimbing method to solve (\ref{jointopt2}) explicitly. We show that the subgradient of the validation loss with respect to the regularization parameters can be calculated in many situations. Therefore, methods like subgradient descent can be used to explore the space efficiently. By avoiding the grid entirely, our method scales well in the number of parameters.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=60mm]{surface_in_regularization_parameters.png}
\end{center}
\caption{We can tune regularization parameters using a grid search... or just descend opposite of the gradient.}
\label{fig:compare}
\end{figure}

Of course, the joint optimization problem is non-convex and therefore our method provides no guarantees. The major benefit of using our method is that it opens up the possibility of using regularization methods that combine multiple penalty terms.

\subsection{Subgradient Descent for Joint Optimization}

In this paper, we present a way of solving the joint optimization problem using subgradient descent and Nesterov's subgradient descent with adaptive restarts (CITE). In the box below, we present the algorithm using subgradient descent. Let $L_V(\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ denote $L(y_V, \hat f(X_V | \boldsymbol{\lambda}))$ for ease of reading.

\begin{center}
  \fbox{
    \parbox{30em}{
        Choose step size $\alpha$. \\
        Let $\boldsymbol{\lambda} = \boldsymbol{\lambda_0}$. \\
	For each iteration $k+1$:
	\begin{equation*}
	\boldsymbol{\lambda}^{(k+1)} := \boldsymbol{\lambda}^{(k)} - \alpha \boldsymbol{g}_V(\boldsymbol{\lambda}^{(k)})
	\end{equation*} where $\boldsymbol{g}_V(\boldsymbol{\lambda}^{(k)})$ is any subgradient of $L_V$ at $\boldsymbol{\lambda}^{(k)}$.
    }
  }
\end{center}

In a few cases, such as ridge regression, calculating a subgradient is straightforward. However, in most cases, calculating a subgradient is more tricky: it requires calculating the implicit subderivatives of minimizers of non-smooth functions over convex sets. By the KKT conditions, the subdifferential of the criterion at the optimal function $\hat f(\cdot | \boldsymbol{\lambda})$ must contain the zero vector:

\begin{equation}
0 \in \delta_{\hat f} \big (L(y_T, \hat f (X_T; \Lambda)) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \lambda_i J_i(\hat f; \Lambda) \big)
\end{equation}
Implicit subdifferentiation of the above equation gives us $\frac{\partial \hat f}{\partial \boldsymbol{\lambda}}$ in terms of $\hat f(\cdot | \lambda)$ (abuse of notation going on?). By the chain rule, we can then calculate a subgradient $\boldsymbol{g}_v(\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ in terms of $\hat f(\cdot | \boldsymbol{\lambda})$.

Therefore, each subgradient update requires solving an "inner" optimization problem for $\hat f(\cdot | \lambda)$ first. While this may seem costly, using warm starts significantly reduces the number of iterations needed to solve the "inner" problem and keeps joint optimization computationally tractable.

\subsection{Joint optimization for example regressions}

Now we present examples of how to formulate regressions for joint optimization and how to derive the subgradients to tune the regularization parameters. We first begin with the simple example of ridge regression. We then follow with the more complicated examples of elastic net, sparse group lasso, and additive partial linear models.

\subsubsection{Ridge Regression}

To perform joint optimization, ridge regression is formulated as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\min_\lambda \frac{1}{2} \lvert\lvert y_V - X_V \hat \beta (\lambda) \rvert\rvert ^2 \\
\text{  where  } \hat \beta (\lambda) = \arg \min_\beta \frac{1}{2} \lvert\lvert y_T - X_T \beta \rvert\rvert ^2 + \lambda \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert\rvert_2^2
\end{array}
\end{equation}

Calculating the gradient is straightforward since there is a closed-form solution for $\hat \beta(\lambda)$:
\begin{equation}
\hat \beta (\lambda) = (X^TX + \lambda I)^{-1}X^Ty
\end{equation}

Differentiating the above equation with respect to $\lambda$ gives us the gradient:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array} {lcl}
\nabla_\lambda L_V(\lambda) &=& - (X_V \frac{\partial \hat\beta}{\partial \lambda})^T (y_V - X_V \hat \beta (\lambda)) \\
&=& (X_V(X_T^T X_T + \lambda I)^{-1}\hat \beta (\lambda))^T(y_V - X_V \hat\beta (\lambda))
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Elastic Net}

The elastic net combines the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalties to address the limitations of lasso and ridge regression. Joint optimization finds the optimal regularization parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ corresponding to each of these penalties:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\min_{\lambda_1, \lambda_2} \frac{1}{2} \bigl\lvert\bigl\lvert y_V - X_V \hat \beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2) \bigl\rvert\bigl\rvert^2_2 \\
\text{ where }
\hat \beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = \arg\min_{\beta} \frac{1}{2} \bigl\lvert\bigl\lvert y_T - X_T\beta \bigl\rvert\bigl\rvert^2_2
+ \lambda_1 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_1
+ \frac{1}{2}\lambda_2 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_2^2
\end{array}
\end{equation}

By the KKT conditions,

\begin{equation}
-X_T^T(y_T - X_T \hat \beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2) ) + \lambda_1 s(\hat \beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2)) + \lambda_2 \hat \beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = 0
\end{equation}
where $s(\beta_i) = sign(\beta_i)$ if $\beta_i \ne 0$ and $s(\beta_i) = 0$ otherwise.

Performing implicit differentiation on the equation above gives us the subgradient:

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{g}_V(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) =
\begin{bmatrix}
(X_V^T(X_T^T X_T + \lambda_2 I)^{-1} s(\hat \beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2)))^T(y_V - X_V \hat\beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2))\\
(X_V^T(X_T^T X_T + \lambda_2 I)^{-1} \hat \beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2))^T(y_V - X_V \hat\beta (\lambda_1, \lambda_2))
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Sparse Group Lasso}

Sparse group lasso, a variant of the classical lasso regression, is intended for modeling problems with grouped covariates believed to have sparse effects on a group and a within-group level. Let $m$ be the number of covariate groups, and split the predictors $X$ into submatrices $X^{(l)}$ and coefficient vector $\beta$ into vectors $\beta^{(l)}$ to correspond with each covariate group $l = 1, ... , m$. Sparse group lasso enforces group-level sparsity and within-group sparsity using the penalties $\sum_{l=1}^m \lvert\lvert \beta^{(l)} \rvert \rvert_2$ and $||\beta ||_1$. Joint optimization seeks the optimal regularization parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\min_{\lambda_1, \lambda_2} \frac{1}{2n} \bigl\lvert\bigl\lvert y_V - \sum\limits_{l=1}^m X_V^{(l)} \hat \beta^{(l)}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) \bigl\rvert\bigl\rvert^2_2 \\
\text{ where }
\hat \beta(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = \arg\min_\beta \frac{1}{2n} \bigl\lvert\bigl\lvert y_T - \sum\limits_{l=1}^m X_T^{(l)} \beta^{(l)} \bigl\rvert\bigl\rvert^2_2
+ \lambda_1 \sum_{l=1}^m \lvert\lvert \beta^{(l)} \rvert \rvert_2
+ \lambda_2 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_1
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The KKT conditions state that
\begin{equation}
-X_T^T(y_T - X_T \hat \beta(\lambda_1, \lambda_2))
+ \lambda_1 \sum\limits_{l=1}^m \frac{ \hat \beta(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)^{(l)}}{||\hat \beta(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)^{(l)} ||_2}
+ \lambda_2 s(\hat \beta(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)) = 0
\end{equation}

Differentiating the KKT conditions gives the subgradient:

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{g}_V(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) =
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{n}
\Bigg (
X_V
(\frac{1}{n} X^T X - \lambda_1M_1 + \lambda_1 M_2)^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\hat\beta^{(1)}}{||\hat\beta^{(1)}||_2}\\
\vdots\\
\frac{\hat\beta^{(m}}{||\hat\beta^{(m}||_2}
\end{bmatrix}
\Bigg )^T
(y_V - X_V \hat \beta)
 \\
\frac{1}{n}
\Bigg (X_V
(\frac{1}{n} X^T X - \lambda_1 M_1 + \lambda_1 M_2)^{-1} s(\hat \beta)
\Bigg )^T
(y_V - X_V \hat \beta)
\\ 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

where $M_1$ is the block diagonal matrix with  components 
$
|| \hat  \beta^{(l)}||_2^{-3}
\begin{bmatrix} 
\hat \beta_1^{(l)} & 0 & \\
0 & \hat \beta_2^{(l)} &  \\
 &  & \ddots \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\text{---} & \hat \beta^{(l)T} & \text{---} \\
\text{---} & \hat \beta^{(l)T} & \text{---} \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}
$ and $M_2$ is the block diagonal matrix with components
$||\hat \beta^{(l)}||_2^{-1} I$
for $l = 1, ..., m$ 
from top left to bottom right.


(Using the notation $\hat \beta(\lambda_1, \lambda_2))$ is very hard to read...)

\subsubsection{Additive Partial Linear Models}

Additive partial linear models (APLMs), a semi-parametric regression model, is useful when the response is believed to depend on some of the predictors in a linear manner and the rest in a nonlinear manner. Given predictors $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ and $z \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times 1}$, APLMs predict the response $y$ as $x^T\beta + g(z)$, where $\beta$ is the vector of regression coefficients and $g: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ is some nonlinear function.

For this example, we specifically consider the case when the criterion contains a lasso penalty for the linear component and an $\ell_2$ trend filtering penalty for the nonlinear component. Joint optimization formulates the problem as:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\min_{\lambda_1, \lambda_2} \frac{1}{2} \bigl\lvert\bigl\lvert y_V - X_V\hat\beta - M_V \hat\theta \bigl\rvert\bigl\rvert^2_2 \\
\text{ where } \hat\beta, \hat\theta = \arg\min_{\beta, \theta} \frac{1}{2} \bigl\lvert\bigl\lvert y - X\beta - M_T \theta \bigl\rvert\bigl\rvert^2_2
+ \lambda_1 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_1
+ \frac{1}{2} \lambda_2 \lvert\lvert D \theta \rvert \rvert_2^2
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $M_V$ is the matrix such that $M_V X = X_V$ and $M_T$ is the matrix such that $M_T X = X_T$ .

$D$ is the second-order difference matrix for unevenly spaced inputs $z$ (Cite Ryan's paper?):
\begin{equation}
D = D^{(1)} \cdot diag \big ( \frac{1}{z_{2} - z_1}, \frac{1}{z_{3} - z_2}, ... , \frac{1}{z_{n} - z_{n-1}}, 0 \big ) \cdot D^{(1)}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
D^{(1)} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1 & 1 & 0 & ... & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1 & 1 & ... & 0 & 0 \\
\vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & ... & -1 & 1 \\
0 &0 & 0 &  0  &  0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\in
\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}
\end{equation}

The KKT conditions state that:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
-X_T^T(y_T - X_T \beta - M_T \theta) + \lambda_1 s(\beta) &=& 0 \\
-M_T^T(y_T - X_T \beta - M_T \theta) + \lambda_2 D \theta &=& 0
\end{array}
\end{equation}

By the chain rule, we know that the components of the subgradient are:
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{g}_V(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3)_i = -(X_V \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \lambda_i} + M_V \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \lambda_i})^T(y_V - X_V \hat \beta - \hat \theta_V)
\end{equation}
and the partial (sub)derivatives (abuse of notation much?), from implicit subdifferentiation of the KKT conditions, are:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \lambda_1} &=& -(X_T^T X_T - X_T^T M_T(M_T^T M_T + \lambda_2 D^TD)^{-1} M_T^T X_T)^{-1} s(\hat \beta) \\
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \lambda_1} &=& -(M_T^T M_T + \lambda_2 D^T D)^{-1} M_T^T X_T \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \lambda_1}
\\
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \lambda_2} &=& -(M_T^T M_T - M_T^T X_T (X_T^TX_T)^{-1} X_T^T M_T + \lambda_2 D^TD) D^TD \theta
\\
\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \lambda_2} &=& - (X_T^TX_T)^{-1} X_T^T M_T \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \lambda_2} \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}


\section{Results: validation error minimization}

We first address the question of whether or not joint optimization can achieve validation loss values as low as grid search. The key metrics in this comparison are, obviously, the average validation loss values for the fitted models and runtime.

We ran our experiments for the example regressions elastic net, sparse group lasso, and APLMs on simulated data. Joint optimization was implemented using gradient descent and Nesterov's gradient descent with adaptive restarts to understand how different implementations affects results. We first delineate the simulation settings and follow with a discussion of the results.

\subsection{Elastic net}
We generated 30 datasets with 80 training and 20 validation observations each and 250 predictors. For the coefficient vector $\beta$, the first 15 values were ones and the rest were zeroes. The pairwise correlation between $x_i$ and $x_j$ was set to be $corr(i,j) = 0.5^{|i-j|}$. The response vector $y$ was constructed as
\begin{equation}
y = X\beta + \sigma \epsilon
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon \sim N(0, 1)$. $\sigma$ was chosen such that the signal to noise ratio is 2.

Joint optimization was initialized at two points (0.01, 0.01) and (10, 10). Grid search was implemented over a $10 \times 10$ grid, starting from 1e-5 to four times the largest eigenvalue of $X_T^T X_T$.

\subsection{Sparse group lasso}

We generated 30 datasets of 60 training and 15 validation observations with 1500 covariates. The predictors $X$ were generated iid gaussian. The response $y$ was constructed as
\begin{equation}
y = \sum\limits_{l=1}^3 X^{(l)} \beta^{(l)} + \sigma \epsilon
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon \sim N(0, 1)$, $\beta^{(l)} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, ..., 0)$ for $l = 1, 2, 3$. $\sigma$ was chosen such that the signal to noise ratio was 2. The number of groups $m$ in the criterion was set to 150.

Joint optimization was initialized at three points, where all regularization parameters were set to 0.01, 1, and 100. Grid search used a $10 \times 10$ grid, starting from 1e-5 to $\max(\{||X^{(l)T}y ||_2\}_{l=1,..., m})$.

\subsection{Additive partial linear models}

We generated 30 datasets with 100 training and 25 validation observations and 21 predictors. The first 20 predictors was the input for the linear function and the last predictor was the input to the nonlinear function. Predictors for the linear function were generated such that the first two groups of three features were highly correlated and the rest of the features were generated iid Gaussian.
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
x_i = Z_1 + \epsilon_i \text{ for } i=1, 2, 3 \\
x_i = Z_2 + \epsilon_i \text{ for } i= 4, 5, 6 \\
x_i \sim N(0,1) \text{ for } i = 7, ..., 20
\end{array}
\end{equation}
where $Z_1 \sim N(0,1)$, $Z_2 \sim N(0,1)$, and $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \frac{1}{16})$. The predictors for the nonlinear component $z$ were randomly drawn from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1. The response $y$ was constructed as
\begin{equation}
y = X\beta + \kappa g(z) + \sigma \epsilon
\end{equation}
The constants $\kappa$ and $\sigma$ were chosen such that the linear to nonlinear ratio $\frac{||X\beta||_2}{||g(Z)||_2}$ was 2 and the signal to noise ratio was 2, respectively. We set $\beta = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, ..., 0)$ and $g(z) =(2-z)\sin(20z^4)$.

Joint optimization was initialized at the four points $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = 10^i$ for $i=-2, ..., 1$. Grid search was performed over a $10 \times 10$ grid, with values ranging from $1e-6$ to $10$.

\subsection{Discussion of results}

Joint optimization and grid search had the same performance in the experiments for all three example regressions. As shown in Table \ref{table:validation} ,
the only difference between grid search and joint optimization is the runtime. As hypothesized, subgradient descent and Nesterov's subgradient descent were much faster than grid search. For all the regression examples, subgradient descent was over 40\% faster and Nesterov's subgradient descent was over 50\% faster.

In addition, Figure \ref{figure:costpath} are example plots of how validation error decreases as joint optimization tunes the regularization parameters. The lowest validation error achieved by grid search is plotted as a horizontal line as reference. In general, Nesterov's subgradient descent requires fewer iterations to find the local minima.

(Do we need to be concerned that we have only shown that grid search and joint optimization produces similar results for criterions with 2 regularization parameters)

\section{Results: regularizations with more than two penalties}

This section shows that joint optimization can effectively and efficiently solve regressions with over two regularization parameters.

We created more complex criterions for the experiments by generalizing the two of the previously mentioned regression examples. For the sparse group lasso, we increased the number of regularization parameters to one plus the number of covariate groups. For the APLM example, we increased the number of regularization parameters to three. For each example, we fitted models using joint optimization and compared against models produced by grid search applied to the original two-penalty problem.

Joint optimization formulations and gradient derivations of these criterions with  are included in the Appendix.

\subsection{Unpooled sparse group lasso}

In sparse group lasso, because all $m$ covariate groups share the same two regularization parameters, the thresholds for setting coefficients and coefficient groups to zero are also shared (CITE). Here, we propose a variant of sparse group lasso such that each covariate group has an individual regularization parameter. This generalization allows for different thresholds for each coefficient and coefficient group, which is a more accurate assumption when modeling covariate groups with very different distributions. The new penalty, which we call "unpooled" sparse group lasso, replaces the original $\lambda_1$ parameter with a set of parameters $\{\lambda_1^{(l)}\}_{l=1,...,m}$:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{l=1}^m \lambda_1^{(l)} \lvert\lvert \beta^{(l)} \rvert \rvert_2
+ \lambda_2 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_1
\end{equation}

To compare the performance of regularization to the original sparse group lasso, we simulate data using the same settings as before. The regularization parameters for unpooled sparse group lasso were initialized at a lower set of values 1e-4, 1e-3, and 1e-2 to compensate for the fact that there are now $m + 1$ regularization parameters. In total, we performed three experiments, varying the number of covariates and the number of covariate groups $m$. 

We measured three metrics for model performance: test error, $\beta$ error, which is defined as $\lvert \lvert \beta - \hat \beta \rvert \rvert_2 ^2$, and the number of nonzero coefficients correctly identified out of the total number of nonzero coefficients in the fitted model.

As seen in Table \ref{table:unpooled}, unpooled sparse group lasso performs better by all metrics in all the experiments. The runtime for joint optimization, even when there are 150 regularization parameters, is still faster than running grid search over the two regularization parameters in sparse group lasso.

\subsection{Additive partial linear models with three regularization parameters}
Most APLMs have at most two regularization parameters because of the computational intractability of having more. Joint optimization gives us the freedom to add many more penalty terms, so we tested whether adding a third penalty improves model performance. For this example, we replaced the lasso penalty with the elastic net penalty:
\begin{equation}
\lambda_1 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_1
+ \frac{1}{2} \lambda_2 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_2^2
+ \frac{1}{2} \lambda_3 \lvert\lvert D^{(2)} \theta \rvert \rvert_2^2
\end{equation}

The experiment was run on simulated data generated using the settings previously specified. To adjust for the additional regularization parameter, joint optimization was initialized at the six points $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \lambda_3 =10^i$ for $i=-4, ..., 1$. We performed tests with three nonlinear functions of varying levels of smoothness.

Models were judged by their predictive accuracy and how closely they could estimate the linear and nonlinear components. For the latter, we used $\beta$ error, defined as $||\beta - \hat \beta||_2^2$, and $\theta$ error, defined as $|| g(z) - \theta ||_2^2$.

The results in Table \ref{ref:aplm} show that using three penalty terms in the criterion significantly improved the models by all metrics. An improvement in predicting the linear regression coefficients $\beta$ was expected since elastic net is well-suited for modeling sparse, correlated data. The improvement in the nonlinear model was less expected, since no additional regularization parameters were added for this. However, it seems that the additional regularization parameter for imposing structure to the linear component also properly imposed structure for the nonlinear component.

Joint optimization for three regularization parameters required a runtime slightly longer than grid search while, nonetheless, remaining very reasonable. The additional regularization parameter resulted in over a two-fold increase in the runtime for joint optimization. The increase in runtime can be attributed to the two additional initialization points and the additional cost of computing the gradient with respect to another regularization parameter. The most important thing to note is that this increase in runtime is not exponential in the number of parameters but, rather, polynomial (can we say this?). Grid search on the other hand would increase the runtime ten-fold for every additional parameter added.

Figure \ref{fig:modelfits} compares example model fits from joint optimization and grid search. The plots of the linear regression coefficient vector show that fits from elastic net regularization tended to have similar nonzero coefficients for the highly-correlated covariates whereas fits from the lasso tended to set some of these coefficients to zero. In addition, when comparing the estimates for the nonlinear component, fits from the elastic net were smoother in general as compared to those from the lasso.

\section{Application to Real Data}
In this section, we discuss the performance and efficiency of joint optimization when applied to real data. We use un-pooled sparse group lasso as our example, since it can have the most number of penalty parameters among the regularization methods we previously mentioned. We compare this to sparse group lasso tuned using grid search.

We run regression to predict disease phenotype from gene expression data, as presented by Noah et. al. (2007). In this problem, the genes are grouped by gene pathways and we are interested in the pathways of interest and, from them, the driving genes.

Our dataset is from a colitis study of 127 total patients, 85 with colitis (59 crohn's patients + 26 ulcerative colitis patients) and 42 health controls (Burczynski 2006). Expression data was measured for 22,283 genes on affymetrix U133A microarrays. We grouped the genes according to the 326 C1 positional gene sets from MSigDb v5.0 (Subramanian 2005) and discarded the 2358 genes not found in the gene set. For each experiment, we randomly shuffled the data and used the first 50 observations for the training set and the remaining 77 for the test set. The experiment was repeated 10 times.

5-fold cross-validation was used to fit models. The penalty parameters in un-pooled sparse group lasso were all initialized at 0.5. For sparse group lasso, models were fit over a $5 \times 5$ grid of parameter values from 1e-4 to 5.

Perhaps the most important result is that joint optimization makes it possible to compare un-pooled sparse group lasso to sparse group lasso. Un-pooled sparse group lasso requires 327 regularization parameters for this problem, which is impossible to tune using grid search. Treating the problem as a continuous optimization problem not only makes it possible to tune many penalty parameters, but also makes the runtime comparable to grid search over two parameters, as seen in Table \ref{colitis}.

Un-pooled sparse group lasso and sparse group lasso achieve similar classification rates around 83\%. The primary difference is that un-pooled sparse group lasso finds solutions that are significantly more sparse than sparse group lasso -- on average, 9 genesets were identified, as opposed to 38. In addition, the number of genesets identified by un-pooled sparse group lasso has significantly lower variance. The number of genesets identified by sparse group lasso ranged from 2 to 73. The number of genesets identified by un-pooled sparse group lasso ranged from 8 to 12. Consistency is certainly an useful quality in regularization methods. These results suggest that un-pooling the penalty parameters in sparse group lasso can improve the regularization method. Further research is needed to determine if un-pooled sparse group lasso is a useful regularization method.

In this example, we have demonstrated that joint optimization is highly efficient at tuning parameters and can produce meaningful solutions to regression problems for real data.

\hline

\hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Discussion}
We proposed using joint optimization for tuning regularization parameters in both linear and nonlinear regressions. By treating the regression as an optimization problem over the regularization parameter space, joint optimization is highly scalable in the number of parameters. Through experiments on simulated data, we demonstrated that joint optimization is able to fit models with validation errors as low as grid search. We then increased the number of regularization parameters in traditional regularization methods and used joint optimization to fit even better models. During this exploration, we discovered that "unpooled" sparse group lasso has significantly better performance than the traditional sparse group lasso. Further research should be done to explore this new regularization method. Finally, we demonstrated that this method works well on real data.

This paper applied joint optimization to a number of criterions, but this method should be tested on more criterions to analyze its robustness. We also expect that by implementing joint optimization with more sophisticated optimization methods, we can expect significant gains in efficiency. Finally, it would be worthwhile to understand what types of situations are ill-suited for joint optimization and what is the maximum number of regularization parameters joint optimization can tune with reasonable computation time.

\subsection{Additive Partial Linear Model Derivations}

\subsubsection{Additive Partial Linear Model Derivations: 3-penalties}

To perform joint optimization, we formulate the problem as follows:
\begin{multline}
\min_{\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3} \frac{1}{2} \bigl\lvert\bigl\lvert y_V - X_V\hat\beta - M_V \hat\theta \bigl\rvert\bigl\rvert^2_2 \\
\text{ where } \hat\beta, \hat\theta = \arg\min_{\beta, \theta} \frac{1}{2} \bigl\lvert\bigl\lvert y - X\beta - M_T \theta \bigl\rvert\bigl\rvert^2_2
+ \lambda_1 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_1
+ \frac{1}{2} \lambda_2 \lvert\lvert \beta \rvert \rvert_2^2
+ \frac{1}{2} \lambda_3 \lvert\lvert D^{(2)} \theta \rvert \rvert_2^2
\end{multline}
where $M_V \in \mathbb{R}^{|V| \times n}$ is the matrix such that $M_V X = X_V$ and $M_T \in \mathbb{R}^{|T| \times n}$ is the matrix such that $M_T X = X_T$ .

The gradients of the validation set error with respect to the regularization parameters are:
\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\lambda_i} L(y_V, X_V \hat \beta + \hat \theta) = (X_V \frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \lambda_i} + M_V \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \lambda_i})^T(y_V - X_V \hat \beta - \hat \theta_V)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \lambda_1} &=& -(X_T^T X_T - X_T^T M_T(M_T^T M_T + \lambda_3 D^TD)^{-1} M_T^T X_T + \lambda_2 I)^{-1} sign(\hat \beta) \\

\\

\\
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \lambda_3} &=& -(M_T^T M_T - M_T^T X_T (X_T^TX_T + \lambda_2 I)^{-1} X_T^T M_T + \lambda_3 D^TD)^{-1} D^TD \theta
\\
\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial \lambda_3} &=& - (X_T^TX_T + \lambda_2 I)^{-1} X_T^T M_T \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial \lambda_3} \\
\end{array}
\end{equation}

The $\beta$ values carry over each iteration in a different manner from that proposed by Lorbert and Ramadge. Instead of deriving the new $\beta$ using cyclical coordinate gradient descent starting from the previous iteration's $\beta$, we use the previous optimal $\beta$ to warm start the inner optimization in step one. By using warm starts, we can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed to find the optimal $\beta$ for the current iteration's regularization parameters.
